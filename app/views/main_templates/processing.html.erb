For testing, we can consider the following transcriptions:

<ol>
<li>"On Tuesday, I need to pick up my dry cleaning."</li>
<li>"I have an assignment for my Digital Marketing Lab class due on Saturday."</li>
<li>"I need to send a follow up email to Jessica about the club."</li>
<li>"I need to go to the banquet next month."</li>
<li>"AYO GPT - can you help a m*f* remember that he's gotta fill up a m*f* car with some m*f* gas by Monday?"</li>
<li>I had a long conversation with my Samuel yesterday. I told him my view of the world - that it's in decay, that we're about to face hard times, and that he shouldn't be too picky in choosing a job. It was a harsh but fair conversation.</li>
